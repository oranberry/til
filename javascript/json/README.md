# Structured Data

Structured data is used by search-engines, like Google, to understand the content of the page, as well as to gather information about the web and the world in general.

It is also coded using in-page markup on the page that the information applies to.

## ðŸ”¸ JSON

JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) is a standard text-based format for representing structured data based on JavaScript object syntax. It is commonly used for transmitting data in web applications (e.g., sending some data from the server to the client, so it can be displayed on a web page, or vice versa).
