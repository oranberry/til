# Keyed Collections

Keyed collections are data collections that are ordered by key not index. They are associative in nature. Map and set objects are keyed collections and are iterable in the order of insertion.

## ðŸ”¸ Map

Map is a collection of keyed data items, just like an Object. But the main difference is that Map allows keys of any type.

## ðŸ”¸ Weak Map

WeakMap is a Map-like collection of key/value pairs whose keys must be objects, it removes them once they become inaccessible by other means.

## ðŸ”¸ Set

The Set object lets you store unique values of any type, whether primitive values or object references. A value in the Set may only occur once; it is unique in the Setâ€™s collection.

## ðŸ”¸ Weak Set

WeakSet objects are collections of objects. Just as with Sets, each object in a WeakSet may occur only once; all objects in a WeakSetâ€™s collection are unique.
