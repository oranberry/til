# Modules

Modules encapsulate all sorts of code like functions and variables and expose all this to other files. Generally, we use it to break our code into separate files to make it more maintainable. They were introduced into JavaScript with ECMAScript 6.

## ðŸ”¸ CommonJS

CommonJS modules are the original way to package JavaScript code for Node.js. Node.js also supports the ESModules standard used by browsers and other JavaScript runtimes, but CJS is still widely used in backend Node.js applications. Sometimes these modules will be written with a .cjs extension.

## ðŸ”¸ ECMAScript Modules (ESModules)

ESModules is a standard that was introduced with ES6 (2015). The idea was to standardize how JS modules work and implement these features in browsers. This standard is widely used with frontend frameworks such as react and can also be used in the backend with Node.js. Sometimes these modules will be written with a .mjs extension.
