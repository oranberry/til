# Í∞ùÏ≤¥(object/reference) ÌÉÄÏûÖ - Î≥µÌï©Îç∞Ïù¥ÌÑ∞

JavaScript object is a data structure that allows us to have key-value pairs; so we can have distinct keys and each key is mapped to a value that can be of any JavaScript data type. JavaScript objects can have properties that define their characteristics.

## üî∏ Built-in Objects

Built-in objects, or ‚Äúglobal objects‚Äù, are those built into the language specification itself. There are numerous built-in objects with the JavaScript language, all of which are accessible at the global scope.  
Some examples are: Number, Math, Date, String, Error, Function, Boolean

## üî∏ Object Prototype

JavaScript is an object-oriented language built around a prototype model. In JavaScript, every object inherits properties from its prototype, if there are any. A prototype is simply an object from which another object inherits properties. To create complex programs using JavaScript, one has to be proficient in working with prototypes ‚Äî they form the very core of OOP in the language.

## üî∏ Prototypal Inheritance

The Prototypal Inheritance is a feature in javascript used to add methods and properties in objects. It is a method by which an object can inherit the properties and methods of another object. Traditionally, in order to get and set the Prototype of an object, we use Object.getPrototypeOf and Object.
