## Tree

A tree is an abstract model of a hierarchical structure
A tree consists of nodes with a parent-child relation
A tree can also be looked at as having vertices and edges without having any cycles
The tree with no nodes is called the null or empty tree
A tree that is not empty consists of a root node and potentially many levels of additional nodes that form a hierarchy
