## üí´ Object-Oriented Design Goals

**Robustness** ‚Äì capable of handling unexpected inputs that are not explicitly defined for its application
**Adaptability** ‚Äì needs to be able evolve over time in response to changing conditions in its environment
**Reusability** ‚Äì the same code should be usable as a component of different systems in various applications

## üí´ Object-Oriented Design Principles

**Abstraction** : distill a complicated system down to its most fundamental parts and describe these parts in a simple, precise language.
Abstraction means displaying only essential information and hiding the details.
‚û∞ Abstraction using Classes: We can implement Abstraction in C++ using classes.
Class helps us to group data members and member functions using available access specifiers.
A Class can decide which data member will be visible to outside world and which is not.
‚û∞ Abstraction in Header files: One more type of abstraction in C++ can be header files.
‚û∞ Abstraction using access specifiers. Access specifiers are the main pillar of implementing abstraction in C++.
We can use access specifiers to enforce restrictions on class members.
For example:
Members declared as public in a class, can be accessed from anywhere in the program.
Members declared as private in a class, can be accessed only from within the class.
They are not allowed to be accessed from any part of code outside the class.

**Encapsulation**: different components of a software system should not reveal the internal details of their respective implementations.
Encapsulation is defined as binding together the data and the functions that manipulates them.
In C++ encapsulation can be implemented using Class and access modifiers.
**Modularity** the process of decomposing a problem (program) into a set of modules so as to reduce the overall complexity of the problem

## Hierarchical Organistion

Structural components of a software package organize in hierarchical fashion, which groups similar abstract definitions together in a level-by-level manner.

A design pattern describes a solution to a ‚Äútypical‚Äù software design problem.

## Inheritance and Polymorphism

The object-oriented paradigm provides a modular and hierarchical structure for reusing code trough a technique called inheritance.

## Template
