// Logical operators
// The ! operator is unary, while && and || are binary.
// The logical operators produce 0 or 1 as their result.
// The logical operators treat any nonzero operand as a true value and any zero operand as a false value.
// The precedence of && and || is lower than that of the relational and equality operators.

i < j &&k == m;
// is equivalent to
(i < j) && (k == m);
