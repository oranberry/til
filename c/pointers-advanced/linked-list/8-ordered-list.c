// ğŸ’« Ordered Lists
// When the nodes of a list are kept in order â€” sorted by the data stored inside the nodes
// â€” we say that the list is ordered.

// Inserting a node into an ordered list is more difficult,
// because the node wonâ€™t always be put at the beginning of the list or the end of the list.
// However, searching is faster: we can stop looking after reaching the point
// at which the desired node would have been located.

// The part structure contains a pointer to the next node:
struct part
{
    int number;
    char name[NAME_LEN + 1];
    int on_hand;
    struct part *next;
};

// inventory will point to the first node in the list:
struct part *inventory = NULL;

// We must determine where the new part belongs in the list and insert it there.
// It will also check whether the part number is already present in the list.
// A loop that accomplishes both tasks:
for (cur = inventory, prev = NULL; cur != NULL && new_node->number > cur->number; prev = cur, cur = cur->next)
    ;

// Once the loop terminates, insert will check
// whether cur isnâ€™t NULL and whether new_node->number equals cur->number.
// If both are true, the part number is already in the list.
// Otherwise, insert will insert a new node between the nodes pointed to by prev and cur.
// This strategy works even if the new part number is larger than any in the list.
