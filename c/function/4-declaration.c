// ðŸ’« Function Declarations
// C doesnâ€™t require that the definition of a function precede its calls.

// For example, when the compiler encounters the first call of average in main,
// it has no information about the function.

// Instead of producing an error message, the compiler assumes that average returns an int value.
// We say that the compiler has created an implicit declaration of the function.

// The compiler is unable to check that weâ€™re passing average the right number of arguments and that the arguments have the proper type.
// Instead, it performs the default argument promotions and hopes for the best.
// When it encounters the definition of average later in the program, the compiler notices
// that the functionâ€™s return type is actually double, not int, and so we get an error message.
// error: conflicting types for â€˜averageâ€™

// C offers a solution: declare each function before calling it.
// A function declaration provides the compiler with a brief glimpse at a function whose full definition will appear later.
// General form of a function declaration:
// return-type function-name ( parameters ) ;

// The declaration of a function must be consistent with the functionâ€™s definition.
// Hereâ€™s the average.c program with a declaration of average added.

#include <stdio.h>
