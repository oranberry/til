// 💫 Constant Arrays
// An array can be made “constant” by starting its declaration with the word const:
const char chars[] = {'0', '1', '2', '3', '4', '5', '6', '7', '8', '9', 'A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F'};

// An array that’s been declared const should not be modified by the program.
// Documents that the program won’t change the array.
// Helps the compiler catch errors.
